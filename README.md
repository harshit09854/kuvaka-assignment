Scoring Logic Explained
Each lead's final score is the sum of a Rule Score and an AI Score.

Rule Layer (Max 50 Points)
This layer provides a baseline score based on concrete data points.

Role Relevance (+20):

+20 points for decision-maker titles (e.g., "Head", "VP", "Director", "Founder", "C-Level").

+10 points for influencer titles (e.g., "Manager", "Senior").

0 points otherwise.

Industry Match (+20):

+20 points for an exact match with the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) industry.

+10 points for an adjacent or related industry.

0 points otherwise.

Data Completeness (+10):

+10 points if all fields (name, role, company, etc.) for the lead are present and not empty.

AI Layer (Max 50 Points)
This layer analyzes the unstructured linkedin_bio in the context of the offer to classify buying intent.

AI Prompt: The core prompt sent to the AI is structured as follows:

"Given this product offer: {offer_details}. And this lead: {lead_details}. Classify the lead's buying intent as High, Medium, or Low. Then, provide a one-sentence explanation for your classification."

Point Mapping: The AI's classification is mapped to a score:

High = 50 points

Medium = 30 points

Low = 10 points

The explanation provided by the AI is returned as the reasoning in the final result.
